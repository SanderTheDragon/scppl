SanderTheDragon's C++ Libraries (scppl)
#######################################
**scppl** is (or will be) a collection of C++ libraries I wrote because I could not find libraries with the functionalities I needed (or wanted).
The following libraries exist:

- `scppl Binary <https://sanderthedragon.gitlab.io/scppl/binary/index.html>`_, a C++20 header-only library for packing, unpacking, encoding and decoding binary data.

Base documentation can be seen `here <https://sanderthedragon.gitlab.io/scppl/index.html>`_.
